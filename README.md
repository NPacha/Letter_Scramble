## Concept:
Letter Scramble is a simple word game that allows two players to exercise their vocabulary knowledge and quick thinking skills. The user is presented with a set of letters from which they must create as many words as they can, and earn points, in a limited amount of time. The player that reaches 200 points wins the game.

## Approach:

#### Overview
Description of how you approach the game development. Here you will add all the development phases, from wireframes to code sample. 

Wireframes mapped out the interface that the user is presented with at each of the main stages in the game. Slight modifications were made as the game was realized. 

The game was started by psuedocoding necessary functionality that the game would include (i.e. player Class, cached DOM nodes, functionality to check win of each player based on score, etc). 

CSS was added after main functionality of game established.

#### User stories

As a user.....\
I expect to see instructions for how the game should be played.\
I expect to see a place where I can customize my name as the player, and my opponents name as the second player.
I expect to clearly see where I need to input the word I create, and be able to press enter instead of clicking button.\
I expect to be able to have some vowels in each mix of letters, to not miss a turn without a word created.\
I expect to be notified who one the game.\
I expect to see my score and my opponenet's score as the game progresses.\
I expect to be able to delete a word in case a word listed is not a real world.\
I expect to be able to play again after the game is over.\    

#### Development Plan 

description of your development plan 

* Development Plan  ONE
* Create wire frame
* Brainstorm actor and actor actions
* Brainstorm user stories
* Development Plan  Two
* Psuedo-code functionality
* Development Plan  Three 
* Start creating functionality, incorporate CSS and HTML
* Development Plan  Four
* Deploy and test game
* Refactor code

#### MVP

* MVP ONE
* 1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery (this game will be played using the DOM, not the console)
* MVP Two
* 2. Hosted on github pages
* MVP Three 
* 3. Commits to github every day
* MVP Four
* .4 A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.


#### Stretch goals

* Stretch goals ONE
* 1. Incorporate CSS and positioning into the app ex. numbers display randomly into a circle, etc.
* Stretch goals Two
* 2. User has ability to play again after the first game is done
* Stretch goals Three 
* 3. Incorporate animations
* Stretch goals Four

## Challenges:

The biggest challenge that I faced with this app was positioning all of the elements as I wanted them to look, as well as making the letters look like they were placed in random locations within the circle div. 
The timer was a challenge as well for me.
