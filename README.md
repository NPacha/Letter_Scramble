## Approach:

#### Overview
Description of how you approach the game development. Here you will add all the development phases, from wireframes to code sample. 

Wireframes mapped out the interface that the user is presented with at each of the main stages in the game. Slight modifications were made as the game was realized. 

The game was started by psuedocoding necessary functionality that the game would include (i.e. player Class, cached DOM nodes, functionality to check win of each player based on score, etc). 

CSS was added after main functionality of game established.

#### User stories

As a user..... 
I expect to see instructions for how the game should be played. 
I expect to see a place where I can customize my name as the player, and my opponents name as the second player. 
I expect to clearly see where I need to input the word I create, and be able to press enter instead of clicking button. 
I expect to be able to have some vowels in each mix of letters, to not miss a turn without a word created. 
I expect to be notified who one the game. 
I expect to see my score and my opponenet's score as the game progresses. 
I expect to be able to delete a word in case a word listed is not a real world. 
I expect to be able to play again after the game is over.
